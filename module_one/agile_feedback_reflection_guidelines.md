# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 
Agile is a quick timeline in order to produce a product that can be shown for feedback.  It is then edited and new expectations are made.  This goes around in a circle. Waterfalls has a longer lead time and less customer feedback.   

2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?
We mostly broke up the features and each handled them seperately.  

3. What role did you take on in the project? 
I encouraged everyone and helped show them what I was working on.

4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?
I'd like to set more concrete expectations and then do a team retro if I don't feel like everyone is living up to their end of the DTR.

5. How does retro function in a team project?
It lets you set expectations and then get back on track if needed.

6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?
We said what we liked thus far.

7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?
I'd like to be more concrete in what I expect from my teammates and set timelines for group working hours.
